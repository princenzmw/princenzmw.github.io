        <h2>About me.</h2>
        <p>I'm an aspiring designer/developer always working to build new skills and hone my existing ones. I enjoy not only the work but the results as well, ranging from the satisfaction of seeing the finished product all the way to the satisfaction of knowing my work is ultimately helping someone somewhere. I look forward to finding work in a firm or company that cares not only about gain but also its positive impact on the world via clients, products, and employees.</p>
        <p>I've spent most of my life attempting to find "my calling", and while I've come to experience work in a great many fields, including residential construction, mechanics, tattooing, glassblowing, and web development just to name a few. I have taken quite easily to all the work I've done over the years and have enjoyed it, but nothing feels quite like this does. I enjoy passion and hope to grow that passion into a career I can enjoy and love.</p>
